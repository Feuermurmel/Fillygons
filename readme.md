# Fillygons

Small, hinged polygons to assemble polyhedrons and play with.


## Setup

The repository needs a working OpenSCAD installation to work, see [OpenSCAD Template](https://github.com/Feuermurmel/openscad-template) for instructions.


## Compiling

Type `make` to build __all__ variations, which takes a very long time. To build just a single piece, use e.g.:

```
make 5-gon-0.4mm.stl
```
